# Repository Guidelines

## Agent Instructions

- Treat AGENTS.md as a "living documentation" that agents are encouraged to modify when those edits help them proceed, unblock work, or clarify procedural gaps.
- Agents are also encouraged to modify (and generate if non-existing) respective AGENTS.md file the the workspace applications in `./apps/*` when helpful.
- The goal is to enable safe, traceable, and minimal self-service changes that reduce repetitive human intervention.
